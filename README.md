# ms-agent-framework-step-by-step-workshop
Hands-on, step-by-step guide to building and operating AI agents with Microsoft’s Agent Framework.

This repository provides the end-to-end materials for a hands-on workshop focused on building, operating, and scaling AI Agents with Microsoft’s Agent Framework. It brings together architecture guidance, multi-agent design patterns, workflow orchestration examples, Responsible AI practices, and secure deployment strategies tailored for enterprise scenarios.

Inside this repo you’ll find structured labs, reference implementations, and modular components that demonstrate how to connect agents with MCP servers, integrate external systems through typed workflows, implement human-in-the-loop flows, and run agents safely within private network environments. Everything is designed to help teams move from conceptual understanding to real-world application—covering low-code agents, data-driven agents, and advanced multi-agent coordination.

This workshop reflects the collective learnings from partner engagements across the Americas, offering a practical path for architects and developers to adopt agentic patterns, accelerate solution delivery, and build AI-first applications with confidence.
